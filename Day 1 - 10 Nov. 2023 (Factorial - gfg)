Ques. You have to find the factorial of the given number in an efficient way?

Using recursion, this code becomes so easy and reliable :
In cpp,
Code :

long long int factorial(int N){
        //code here
        if(N==0) return 1;
        //if greater
        return N * factorial(N-1); //used recursion here
    }

Explanation :
0! = 1 (by default)
1! = 1*0! = 1
and so on.
So for say N = 3, then
lets just divide the problem as f(3), here 3!=0, so we skip to the recursive part : N * factorial(N-1), i.e. 3*f(2)
f(2) = 2*f(1)
f(1) = 1 * f(0), now N become 0, we gives us 1, so now step back to problem, one by one , f(1) = 1 * 1 = 1
f(2) = 2 * 1 = 2
f(3) = 3 * 2 = 6.
which ultimately gives correct ans as fact of 3 is 6.
This is how it works so simply.
