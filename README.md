# QOTD
DSA (Question of the day) - a daily updated QOTD repo to look for one of the questions, that I usually solve in a day. Hope this would help you too.

Hi, My name is Moksh Mehan. I'm an aspiring software engineer, I have created this repository to help me to regain the command on some already done ques. in the past or to practice some new ones too. 
I have expertise in multiple programming languages and also have a skill set, that I have shown by making some of the brilliant projects during my college time. You can check my work on my LinkedIn profile. Here is the link --> {www.linkedin.com/in/moksh-mehan-7280381b3}

I have also completed 400+ DSA questions on the coding platforms like Leetcode(300+) & Gfg(100+), which helps to gain so much practical knowledge on the dsa fundamentals and improve my problem solving skills.
