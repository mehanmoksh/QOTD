Problem Statement
You are given three integers, 'X', 'Y', and 'Z.
Report An Issue
Your task is to discover and return all integers from the range of '1' to 'Z'. The integers should be such that when divided by
'X', they yield a remainder of 'Y'.
Note The sequence of these returned integers can be in any
order
Example:
'X'
1Â¥' = 2
'Z' = 10
From '1' to '10', the numbers which, on dividing by '3', give '2' as a remainder are
'2', '5', and '8'.
Therefore, the answer is [2, 5, 8].

Code in cpp :

vector<int> iterateTillZ(int x, int y, int z) {
    // Write Your Code Here
    //run a loop starting from 1 till z and there divide the current element with x
    //if that gives remainder as y, then returns that element 

    vector<int>answer;
    for(int i = 1; i<=z; i++){
        if(i%x == y){
            answer.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return answer;
}
